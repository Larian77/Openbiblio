		<h3>Procedure</h3>
		<div class="notice">Steps 1-8: detail is out of date, but the
			basics are still valid.</div>
		<ol>
			<li>To use your system for OpenBiblio you have to install a
				webserver, PHP and MySQL. If you didn't done it already, i recommend
				to use the package-manager with Linux or <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a>
				for the installation with windows. (i want to thank
				Christopher Dagleish for the hint to XAMPP :-))
			</li>
			<li>At Windows: Download <a
				href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> in the
				version, which your system needs, the Lite-version is sufficient but
				i recommend the full version nevertheless (this version offers
				regulary updates...). Following install the downloaded XAMPP (the
				installation is described on the site of the corresponding
				XAMPP-version in english, so i didn't explain it here, but please
				read everything there :-)). Now you should start XAMPP (it's
				explained there how) and you have a running Apache, PHP and MySQL.
				Continue now with the installation of OpenBiblio at point 7.!
			</li>
			<li>The following points 4-6 you only have to do, if you didn't
				installed XAMPP (or XAMPP doesn't run):</li>
			<li>Install a web server such as <a
				href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> that is compatible with
				PHP. If you install Apache, get familiar with starting and stopping
				your Apache Web Server. If you are running Linux your Apache server
				should be packaged with your Linux installation and will start when
				you start Linux.
			</li>
			<li>Add PHP to your web server as a CGI or a module. If you are
				using Apache 2.0, I would highly recommend that you install PHP as a
				module instead of a cgi application. In my experience the Apache PHP
				module performed over 4 times faster than the cgi PHP. See <a
				href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/install.apache2.php">Example
					3-9. PHP and Apache 2.0 as Module</a> in the <a
				href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/">PHP Manual</a> for more info on
				how to install PHP as a module.
				<p>OpenBiblio uses session data. Therefore, you will need to
					make sure PHP sessions are turned on. Be sure to create a directory
					for your session data on your server and specify the
					session.save_path in your php.ini file. The default php.ini sets
					session.save_path to "/tmp". Therefore, you have to create a
					directory called c:/tmp (for Windows) users. However, I usually
					create a more descriptive name inside my PHP directory and then
					change my php.ini file to match it.
				<p>Example php.ini directive:
				<pre>session.save_path = d:\PHP\sessiondata</pre>

				<p>
					See section <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.session.php">XCIII.
						Session handling functions</a> in the PHP manual for more details on
					PHP sessions.
			</li>
			<li>Install the MySQL database from <a
				href="http://www.mysql.com/">http://www.mysql.com/</a>. Get familiar
				with starting and stopping your MySQL Server.<br> <br>If
				you are running Linux, MySQL should be packaged with your Linux
				installation and will start when you start Linux.
			</li>
			<li>The following points are describing the installation of
				OpenBiblio and have to be done from everything, who install
				OpenBiblio at the first time (never mind if you use XAMPP or
				installed apache, PHP and MySQL on a other way):</li>
			<li>Get familiar with logging into MySQL with your admin account
				within a DOS prompt window. You can use the following command
				sequence as a test.
				<blockquote>
					<pre>
C:\><b>c:\mysql\bin\mysql -uroot mysql</b>
Enter password: <b>*********</b>
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 8 to server version: 3.23.26-beta

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer

mysql> <b>show databases;</b>
+--------------+
| Database     |
+--------------+
| mysql        |
+--------------+
6 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> <b>exit</b>
Bye

C:\>
</pre>
				</blockquote>
			</li>

			<li id="step9">Create an OpenBiblio database. To do this, log
				into MySQL with your admin account and run the following SQL
				command.
				<blockquote>
					<pre>
mysql> <b>create database OpenBiblio /*!40100 default character set utf8 */;</b>
</pre>
					<div class="new">
						<strong>New:</strong> The conditional comment <b>/* ... */ </b>is
						executed on MySQL 4.1.0 or higher and specifies utf8_general_ci as
						the default database character set for the database created.
					</div>
					<br>
					<div class="notice">
						In old instructions latin1 was recommended, but on modern systems
						you should use utf8 to display all needed characters.
						<table border="1">
							<tr>
								<th>database&nbsp;character&nbsp;set</th>
								<th>tab Admin: Library Settings, field <i>HTML&nbsp;Charset</i></th>
								<th>comment</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>latin1</td>
								<td>iso-8859-1</td>
								<td>Problems with displaying some special characters.</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>utf8<br> <i>(recommended)</i></td>
								<td>UTF-8<br> <i>(initial value, set by install)</i></td>                                                   
								<td>problems with PDF layouts, will be fixed soon</td>
							</tr>
						</table>
					</div>
					<br> To check to make sure the OpenBiblio database was created
					properly, run the following command.
					<pre>
mysql> <b>show databases;</b>
+--------------+
| Database     |
+--------------+
| mysql        |
| OpenBiblio   |
+--------------+
</pre>
				</blockquote>
			</li>

			<li id="step10">Create an OpenBiblio database user. To do this,
				login to MySQL under the admin userid and run the following SQL
				command, substituting <i>obiblio_user</i> and <i>obiblio_password</i>
				with the userid and password of your choice.
				<blockquote>
					<pre>mysql> <b>grant all privileges on OpenBiblio.* to <i>obiblio_user</i>@localhost identified by '<i>obiblio_password</i>';</b></pre>
				</blockquote>
				<li>Verify your OpenBiblio database and user by logging into the new
				MySQL database under the new user.
				<blockquote>
					<pre>
<b>C:\mysql\bin\mysql -u<i>obiblio_user</i> -p<i>obiblio_password</i> OpenBiblio</b>
</pre>
				</blockquote>
			</li>

			<li id="step11">Copy the openbiblio directory and all of its
				contents into your web server's htdocs root or any subdirectory
				within the htdocs root.</li>

			<li id="step12">Edit the database_constants.php file (located in
				the main openbiblio directory) with the text editor of your choice.
				Change the username and password to match the new MySQL user and
				password that you created in the previous steps.</li>
                        <li id="step13">Edit the file global_constants.php (located in the shared directory of openbiblio) 
                                with a text editor of your choice. Change the following two constants according to your choice:<br />
                                --> OBIB_UPGRADE_KEY 
                                --> OBIB_PWD_FORGOTTEN_KEY</li>
			<li>Create the OpenBiblio database tables. To do this run the
				install php script located at <a
				href="http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>For security:</strong> Verify that the
				display_errors setting in php.ini is 'Off' to prevent unintended
				information disclosure.</li>
			<li><strong>For security:</strong> Change to
				openbiblio-directory. Change group of file database_constants.php to
				apache-group (www-data) and change the mod of the file to 440 or 400.
				(chgrp www-data database_constants.php; chmod 440 or chmod 400
				database_constants.php)</li>
			<li>Access your new library automation system at <a
				href="http://localhost/openbiblio/index.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/index.php</a>,
				assuming you placed the openbiblio directory in the root htdocs
				directory. Enter "admin" for the userid and for password "Administrator#1" whenever
				you are prompted to signon. You can change the admin password from
				the "Admin" tab -> staff list, where you can also add more library
				staff members.</li>
                        <li>Under admin --> Library settings, system-relevant settings can be made, including whether or 
                                not library users can access their personal account online.</li>
                        <li>In order to be able to use the mail dispatch for e.g. "forgotten password function" or 
                                "welcome message" you must enter a valid e-mail address as the sender for the

		<h1 id="userlogin">Setup of Userlogin:</h1>
		<p>In general, a decision must be made as to whether Openbiblio should be 
                    a pure administration programme without online login access for users 
                    or whether they should be given online login access. 
                    The setting for this can be found via the ‚ÄòAdmin‚Äô tab under the ‚ÄòLibrary settings‚Äô link.
                    This setting can be made accordingly during the update to 0.8.1.</p>
                <p>The user login will be changed from version 0.8.1. The password of the user (member) 
                    is now stored in encrypted form in the DB table member. Previously created 
                    passwords under the member field ‚Äòsecret‚Äô are automatically copied during 
                    the update and stored encrypted in the DB table member. The ‚Äòsecret‚Äô fields 
                    that are no longer required in the member_fields and member_fields_dm 
                    DB tables are then deleted.</p>
                <p>In addition, the user is blocked for a certain period of time if the access 
                    data is entered incorrectly too often.
                    When updating to 0.8.1, the number of failed attempts and the blocking time 
                    can be set during the update. the blocking time can be set. Otherwise, 
                    these settings can be changed at any time via the ‚ÄòAdmin‚Äô tab tab under 
                    the ‚ÄòLibrary settings‚Äô link.</p>
		<p>If online login access for users has been permitted in the library settings, </p>
		<ol>
			<li>the user can access the user login button under the link. <a
				href="http://localhost/openbiblio/index.html">http://localhost/openbiblio/index.html</a>.</li>
			<li>the password must be created when the new user is created.</li>
			<li>The user can log in via the ‚ÄòUser login‚Äô button or via the link.
                            <a
				href="http://localhost/openbiblio/opac/loginform.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/opac/loginform.php</a> 
                            Via their user account, users can renew their media, place advance orders 
                            and change their password.</li>
		</ol>


		<br>
		<h1 id="update">Updating from a previous version of OpenBiblio:</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Rename your old openbiblio installation directory so that
				you don't lose its contents. We'll call the old directory
				openbiblio-old.</li>
			<li>Copy the new openbiblio directory and all of its contents
				into the directory where the old openbiblio installation was.</li>
			<li>Copy the database_constants.php file from the openbiblio-old
				directory into the new openbiblio directory, replacing the
				database_constants.php file there.</li>
			<li>Backup your database. See your MySQL documentation for
				instructions. (use mysqldump)</li>
                        <li>The upgrade key, which is stored under the constant OBIB_UPGRADE_KEY 
                                in the file ../shared/global_constants.php, is required for updating.</li>
			<li>Update your OpenBiblio database tables by using the
				conversion tool located at <a
				href="http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php">http://localhost/openbiblio/install/index.php</a>,
				assuming you placed the openbiblio directory in the root htdocs
				directory. When installed on a remote host, the first part of the
				address will be different. IIf the tables are already OK then
				the tool reports this back accordingly.
			</li>
			<li><strong>For security:</strong> The directory openbiblio/install directory 
                                can be deleted completely after the installation or update. 
                                However, this is no longer necessary from version 0.8.1, 
                                as the update process is the update process is secured via the 
                                upgrade key.</li>
			<li><strong>For security:</strong> Verify that the
				display_errors setting in php.ini is 'Off' to prevent unintended
				information disclosure.</li>
			<li><strong>For security:</strong> Change to
				openbiblio-directory. Change group of file database_constants.php to
				apache-group (www-data) and change the mod of the file to 440 or 400.
				(chgrp www-data database_constants.php; chmod 440 or chmod 400
